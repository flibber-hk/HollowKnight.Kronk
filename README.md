# HollowKnight.Kronk

Simple counter used for speedruns. Currently supports Levers (for Kronk% speedrun) and Rocks (for All Geo Rocks), but more can be added easily.

The mod will set the Hunter's Mark player data bool when you finish the run (63 levers / 207 rocks), so you can add the HuntersMark autosplit to automatically end the run.

Some settings can be toggled from the in-game mod menu.
