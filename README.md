# HollowKnight.Kronk

Simple counter usable for speedruns. Currently supports Levers (for Kronk% speedrun), Rocks (for All Geo Rocks), and Totems (for All Soul Totems) but more can be added easily.

The mod will set the Hunter's Mark player data bool when you finish the run (63 levers / 207 rocks / 59 totems), so you can add the HuntersMark autosplit to automatically end the run.

The counter will not appear when starting a file until you leave King's Pass, or increment the counter (so for example the rock counter will appear when you break the first KP rock, but the lever counter will not appear until leaving King's Pass).

## Menu

The following settings can be toggled from the in-game mod menu (settings -> options -> mods)
- Show Counter: if this is set to off, the counter will not appear (obviously it must be left on for speedruns).
- Counting: toggle this to set which object to count. All countable objects will be counted, but only the selected option will be displayed (and only the selected option will trigger the Hunter's Mark autosplit).
- Counter Position: toggle this to choose between several (self-explanatory) positions for the counter - options include the top-right, bottom-left and bottom-right corners of the screen, as well as the top left (either above or below the HUD).

## Counters

- The lever counter counts levers required by the Kronk% speedrun - so the Mantis Rewards lever is counted when entering the rewards room with Mantis Lords defeated, and the Godhome P5 lever is not counted (or required).
